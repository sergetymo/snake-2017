A classic snake game written as a test assignment to join Neotech Development frontend team.

## Prerequisites
* Installed `node.js`
* Either `npm` or `yarn` package manager

## Install
* `git clone git@gitlab.com:atelier/snake.git && cd snake`
* `npm install` or `yarn`

## Usage

This puts standalone, transpiled and ready-to-use version into `dist/` folder.

* Webpack and Babel to transpile code into browser-executable JavaScript.
* Native DOM API to manipulate nodes.
* Pluggable renderer interface to implement, for example, console-based output.
